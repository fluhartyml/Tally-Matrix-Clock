Getting Help
Thank you for using Tally Matrix Clock! If you need assistance, you’re in the right place.
Quick Start Guide
How to Use the App
	1.	Launch Tally Matrix Clock on your Apple TV
	2.	The clock will immediately begin displaying the current time using illuminated matrix squares
	3.	Press any directional button or the Play/Pause button on your Apple TV remote to access Settings
Understanding the Display
	•	Each digit of the time is shown by a matrix of squares
	•	The number of lit squares equals the digit’s value
	•	Example: If 3 squares are lit, that digit is “3”
	•	The leftmost 1×3 matrix shows the tens place of hours
	•	In 12-hour mode, the bottom square of the leftmost matrix lights up to indicate PM
Accessing Settings
Press any direction on your Apple TV remote or the Play/Pause button to open the Settings menu.
Settings Explained
Show Base-10 Time
Toggle the traditional time display (like “12:11”) on or off at the bottom of the screen. Leave it on while learning, turn it off once you master reading the matrices.
24-Hour Clock
Switch between 12-hour format (with AM/PM) and 24-hour military time format.
Color Scheme
	•	Random RGB (Each Square): Every square gets a random color (red, green, or blue)
	•	Matrix Colors (Per Matrix): All squares in each digit matrix share the same color
	•	Single Color (All Matrices): All lit squares across the entire display use the same color
Pattern Change Interval
Choose how often the lit squares reorganize their positions:
	•	5s - Very dynamic, changes every 5 seconds
	•	15s - Moderate movement
	•	30s - Subtle changes
	•	60s - Calm, changes once per minute
Frequently Asked Questions
Why aren’t the squares in the same position every time?
This is by design! The squares randomly reorganize at your chosen interval to create visual interest while maintaining accurate time display.
How do I read the time?
Simply count the lit squares in each matrix:
	•	First matrix (1×3): Tens place of hours (0-2)
	•	Second matrix (3×3): Ones place of hours (0-9)
	•	Third matrix (3×3): Tens place of minutes (0-5)
	•	Fourth matrix (3×3): Ones place of minutes (0-9)
What does the bottom square on the left mean?
In 12-hour mode, the bottom square of the leftmost 1×3 matrix serves as the PM indicator. If it’s lit, the time is PM. If it’s dark, the time is AM.
Can I use this as a screensaver?
Yes! Just leave the app running. It functions perfectly as an always-on clock display.
Troubleshooting
The app won’t open Settings
Make sure you’re pressing directional buttons or Play/Pause on your Apple TV remote. The app responds to navigation commands.
The time seems wrong
Tally Matrix Clock uses your Apple TV’s system time. Check your Apple TV’s Settings > General > Date and Time to ensure your time zone is set correctly.
Colors aren’t changing
Check your Pattern Change Interval setting. If it’s set to 60 seconds, changes happen once per minute. Try setting it to 5 seconds to see more frequent updates.
The app crashed or froze
Force quit the app and relaunch it:
	1.	Double-press the TV button on your remote
	2.	Swipe up on Tally Matrix Clock to close it
	3.	Relaunch from the Home screen
